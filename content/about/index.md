I'm Hamed Samsami, a Hydroinformatics Engineer from Iran, now living in beautiful Norway. My story is about merging two passions: water and technology.

## Teenage Coder: The Early Days

As a teenager, I spent countless late nights at my computer. While my friends were playing video games and chatting on Yahoo, I was learning to write code and participating in programming competitions.

My interest in computer science never waned. Even while studying civil engineering, I used my free time to build websites for friends, local schools, and various small projects. I became the go-to person for computer problems among family and friends.

## Building a Better World: My Civil Engineering Journey

Picture this: You're standing in front of a huge dam you helped build. You know that because of your work, thousands of people now have water and electricity. That's why I became a civil engineer. I wanted to build things that make life better for lots of people and last for a long time.

I studied civil engineering in university. While learning, I realized something important. The future of civil engineering isn't just about building bigger things. It's about making buildings that don't harm the environment as much. We call this being "Sustainable".

I also learned about a big problem called "Climate Change". It's making floods and droughts happen more often. This makes life harder for people. As engineers, we need to get ready for these changes.

These ideas got me really interested in water and the environment. So, I pursued a master's degree in Hydraulic Structures Engineering. This means I learned how to build dams, channels, water distribution systems, and flood protection systems.

## The Perfect Blend: When Water Met Code

During my master's degree, my two passions converged. For my dissertation, I used Python to create hydraulic models. This perfect blend of water and programming was exhilarating.

Over my 15-year career, I've had the privilege of working on incredible infrastructure projects. From initial sketches to final construction, I've been involved in planning, designing, and overseeing the entire process.

Throughout this journey, I've sought ways to introduce new technologies into our field. I'm always experimenting with the latest software, encouraging colleagues to embrace these tools. I've even created software tools to streamline our work, sharing them with my peers.

## Startup Adventures: A Part-Time Plunge into Tech

In my free time, I began working remotely part-time with several Canadian startups as a software developer. It was like stepping into a different world.

Working alongside expert back-end and front-end developers, data scientists, DevOps engineers, designers, and product managers, I learned a lot about how agile companies operate. For example, I developed a mobile app for a scientific startup that helps oceanographers collect and organize field data with ease.

These experiences have been more than just side projects. They've been a bridge, connecting my world of water engineering with the fast-paced realm of technology startups.

## The Hydroinformatics Revolution: Why Water Needs Tech?

Working in two separate industries simultaneously, a question persistently occupied my mind: While the IT world races ahead, creating amazing tools that simplify complex tasks, why does the water industry (and civil engineering in general) often lag behind?
Water engineers still use software that was groundbreaking decades ago, created by brilliant minds of the past. But in this age of Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, IoT, Virtual Reality, and Blockchain, we need a revolution to tackle complex water challenges.

I dream of a future where cutting-edge technologies are implemented in the water industry. Where machine learning predicts flood patterns, IoT sensors monitor water quality in real-time, and virtual reality helps us design more efficient water systems. This is why I've become a Hydroinformatics Engineer.

## Decoding Hydroinformatics: Where Water Meets Tech

Hydroinformatics is a cutting-edge field that harnesses the power of computer science to tackle complex water-related challenges.
At its core, hydroinformatics is about turning vast amounts of water data into actionable insights. We use sophisticated algorithms to process information from various sources - satellite imagery, ground sensors, historical records, and more - to create comprehensive models of water systems.

But hydroinformatics isn't just about technology - it's about impact. Our work has the potential to save lives by improving flood warnings, conserve precious water resources through better management, and help communities adapt to the impacts of climate change on their water systems.

As we face growing challenges like water scarcity and extreme weather events, the role of hydroinformatics becomes increasingly crucial. We're at the forefront of developing solutions that will shape the future of water management globally.
The field is rapidly evolving, with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and big data analytics opening up new possibilities.

This is why I'm so excited to be part of this field. Every project presents a unique set of challenges, like a complex puzzle waiting to be solved. The future of water management is digital, and as a hydroinformatics engineer, I'm thrilled to be part of it. In my work, I employ a diverse toolkit: Python, R, MATLAB, GIS tools, and other specialized software.

## Welcome to My Digital Garden: Growing Ideas Together

My website is what I call a Digital Garden. Think of it as a place where ideas grow, like plants in a real garden. Here, you'll find topics about water, tech, programming, and data. It showcases what I'm learning and how I aim to help others learn too.

Anyone can contribute to its growth. You can find all the articles and code of my website on GitHub. I welcome ideas to make it better - after all, the best gardens flourish with help from many people.

From my early days of coding until now, I've been learning and growing continuously. I'm always excited to meet people who are interested in water management, technology, or both. Feel free to explore my digital garden, get in touch, and learn with me.
